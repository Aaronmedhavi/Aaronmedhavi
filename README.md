| Dive into Velocity Pursuit, where you race through dynamic tracks, challenge your limits in time trials, and engage in high-stakes races. As the programmer, I created the main racing mechanic for the AI racer by utilizing waypoints, the main car controller mechanic with gamepad integration, and the UI integration. | Zero Hour Assault is a first-person where you play as a lone soldier battling enemy forces in a city. Navigate streets, engage in close-quarters combat, and use the urban environment to outsmart your enemies. As the programmer for this project, I handle all the main aspects for this game which includes player movement, NavMesh, state machine, and weapon mechanics. |

| Pong Star is a 2D space-themed take on the classic Pong game. In this game, players control ships to hit a ball back and forth in a space environment filled with planets and stars. As the programmer, I coded the main ball, player, and scoring mechanics. I also implemented Unity Netcode multiplayer into the game that allows players to play multiplayer from different devices. | A Warriors Journey is an exciting 2D sidescroller game developed using the Unity game engine. Embark on an adventure through beautifully crafted levels, overcome challenges, and defeat enemies as you progress through the game. As the programmer, I created the main player and enemy movement, health, and attack mechanics. I also handled the level design using a tilemap and managed the save game mechanic using JSON. |
