| Zero Hour Assault is a first-person  where you play as a lone soldier battling enemy forces in a city. Navigate streets, engage in close-quarters combat, and use the urban environment to outsmart your enemies. As the programmer for this project, I handle all the main aspects for this game which includes player movement, NavMesh, state machine, and weapon mechanics. | Dive into Velocity Pursuit, where you race through dynamic tracks, challenge your limits in time trials, and engage in high-stakes pursuits. As a solo developer, I created the main level using terrain and RoadArchitect and the main car controller mechanic with gamepad integration. |

| Pong Star is a 2D space-themed take of the classic Pong game. In this game, players control ships to hit a ball back and forth in a space environment filled with planets and stars. As the programmer, I coded the main ball, player, and scoring mechanic. I also implement a unity netcode multiplayer into the game that allows player to play multiplayer from different devices. | A Warriors Journey is an exciting 2D sidescroller game developed using Unity game engine. Embark on an adventure through beautifully crafted levels, overcome challenges, and defeat enemies as you progress through the game. As the programmer, I created the main player and enemy movement, health, and attack mechanics. I also handle the level design using a tilemap and handle the save game mechanic using JSON. |
